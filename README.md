# NowShowing
A UI Client for NextPVR, to make finding new shows and one-time specials easier to find.

You can edit "Exclude.txt" to hide shows you are not interested in.

You can edit "Query.sql" for a more advanced way to hide entire channels.

Unofficial, not affiliated with NextPVR, and I'll take some feedback.  Not looking to turn this into a super user-friendly thing unless it attracts significant attention.
